                    Choose your gauntlets wisely. In Spellbreak, you can dual-wield magical gauntlets that each have two different abilities, giving you four active combat options and a myriad of combination possibilities. Runes provide powerful movement and support abilities to round out your magic arsenal. The balance of fast movement and numerous skillshot abilities creates a deep, skill-based combat system for players to master.
                </li>
                <li class="about-list-create"><span >Create Elemental Spell Combinations</span><br>
                    Use wind to launch yourself skyward or create a tornado that will pull your enemies in. Then light the tornado on fire or electrify it with lightning to ensure maximum damage. Grab a frost gauntlet to lay a path of ice that you and your teammates can skate down at super-speed or melt it with a fireball. There are dozens of spell combinations in Spellbreak and you will need to master all of them if you want to outlast your enemies.

                        In addition to the over-the-top combat, we wanted to bring the joy of RPGs and character customization to Spellbreak. Not only can you dual-wield gauntlets, but you can choose a class that unlocks various skills, as well as equip a vast array of powers to further customize your playstyle. Play your own way or team up with friends to synergize your builds (or accidentally set a teammate on fire. Whoops.)

                        To win in Spellbreak, it takes quick combat skill, clever magical tactics, smart strategic choices, and a little bit of luck. We know that Spellbreak will be at home on PS4 and we canâ€™t wait to share it with all of you.
